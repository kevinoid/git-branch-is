# Note:  semantic-release caches node_modules and `npm prune` in before_script
# https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/v6.2.0/.travis.yml#L3
# Since cache is stored in S3 and npm repository is a caching proxy, why bother?

install:
  # Ignore package-lock.json.  This is done for a few reasons:
  # - To test against current versions of dependencies.
  # - To test installability for dependents (doesn't use package-lock.json).
  - rm -f package-lock.json
  - npm install
