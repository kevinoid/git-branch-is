A Node.js/npm project template with [codecov](https://codecov.io/),
[coveralls](https://coveralls.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/),
[conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-cli),
[nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc), [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/), and
[mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

It is the template that I am using for my own Node.js projects, which
represents my current preferences.  I am not advocating for these choices nor
this template specifically, although I am happy to discuss or explain any
choices made herein.  It is being published both for my own convenience and
in case it may be useful to others with similar tastes.

project, opening an issue before writing the code can avoid frustration and
save a lot of time and effort.
